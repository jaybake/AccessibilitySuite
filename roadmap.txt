Accessibility Suite Roadmap

Right now this software is one that takes care of most of the requirements of
Section 508 compliance for a wordpress website. The exception is for the transcripts
feature. For this inaugural release of the software in the open source market I've
decided to set that as the first priority for developing further releases of this
wonderful software.

1. Transcripts module for deaf and hearing impaired
2. Closed Captioning for audios and videos for the hearing impaired.
3. Descriptive video module for blind and sight impaired
4. Finish out WCAG 2.0 integration
5. Fully integrate WIA/ARIA Standards

I will expand on numbers 4 and 5 as time fits in. Thank you all for your generous
support and well wishes.

This has been a long standing dream of mine to see released and see it as a help
to those seeking better accessibility online.

In Christ,
